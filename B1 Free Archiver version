# CVE - Mark of the Web (MotW) Bypass in B1 Free Archiver
ðŸŽ¥ Proof of Concept (PoC) Video - https://youtu.be/79tYQo2Bkog

Description:
A vulnerability in B1 Free Archiver v1.5.86 allows extracted files from downloaded archives to bypass Windows Mark of the Web (MotW) protections. When a file is downloaded from the internet and extracted using B1 Free Archiver, the extracted files do not retain the `Zone.Identifier` alternate data stream.

As a result, these files can be executed without triggering SmartScreen warnings or security prompts, which would normally appear when opening files from untrusted sources.

Impact:
- MotW is not applied to extracted files
- Windows treats the files as trusted
- Potential for code execution without user warning
- Enables social engineering attacks or malware delivery

How to Reproduce:
1. Download a `7Z.zip` file from the internet containing an executable.
2. Extract the file using B1 Free Archiver.
3. Attempt to read the `Zone.Identifier`:

powershell:
Get-Content .\fake-link -Stream Zone.Identifier
