## ðŸ“„ Description

A vulnerability in **B1 Free Archiver v1.7.120.0** allows extracted files from downloaded archives to **bypass Windows' Mark of the Web (MotW)** protections. When a file is downloaded from the internet and extracted using B1 Free Archiver, the extracted files do **not retain the `Zone.Identifier` alternate data stream**.

As a result, these files can be executed **without triggering SmartScreen warnings** or security prompts, which would normally appear when opening files from untrusted sources.

## ðŸ’¥ Impact

- MotW is not applied to extracted files
- Windows treats the files as trusted
- Potential for code execution without user warning
- Enables social engineering attacks or malware delivery

## ðŸ§ª How to Reproduce

1. Download a `.zip` file from the internet containing an executable.
2. Extract the file using **B1 Free Archiver**.
3. Attempt to read the `Zone.Identifier`:

```powershell
Get-Content .\malicious.exe -Stream Zone.Identifier
